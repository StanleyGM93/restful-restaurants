# Restful Restaurants

## Purpose and Method

This project was designed to further my skills in connecting frontend code with backend code. In this project I created four functions for a restaurant review site to complete CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations with "starred" restaurants. The bulk of the code was supplied by [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) with instructions on how to set up the project. In this project I specifically worked on the backend/routes/starredRestaurants.js file to create route endpoints for the frontend to use. Once this was completed I completed some minor debugging to get the project to successfully compile.
